# Airline Data Warehouse Project

This repository contains the educational course project for a Data Warehouse subject. The project is designed for an airline company and is structured into eight main tasks, each representing a crucial aspect of data warehouse development and management.

## Tasks

### Task 1 Specifying Requirements for BI System and Preparing Data Sources
This task focuses on defining the requirements for a Business Intelligence (BI) system tailored for an airline company. It involves identifying key data sources, understanding the data flow, and preparing these sources for integration into the BI system.

### Task 2 Data Generator for Data Sources
Here, the aim is to develop a data generator for creating realistic data that mimics the airline's operational data. This task is crucial for testing and development purposes, ensuring that the data warehouse can handle and process data accurately.

### Task 3 Data Warehouse Design
This task is about designing the architecture of the data warehouse. It includes creating schemas, identifying key dimensions and facts, and ensuring the design supports efficient querying and data retrieval for the airline's needs.

### Task 4 Data Warehouse Implementation
In this phase, you'll implement the data warehouse design. This involves setting up the database, creating tables, and establishing relationships according to the design specified in Task 3.

### Task 5 Implementation of ETL Process
Task 5 focuses on implementing the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. This is a key step where data is extracted from various sources, transformed for consistency, and loaded into the data warehouse.

###  Task 6 MDX Queries
This task requires writing MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) queries. MDX is used for querying and manipulating multidimensional data stored in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes, which is a crucial aspect of BI applications.

### Task 7 Data Warehouse Optimization Techniques
Here, the goal is to apply optimization techniques to the data warehouse. This includes performance tuning, indexing, and implementing strategies for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Task 8 Data Visualization
The final task is about visualizing the data stored in the data warehouse. This involves creating dashboards, reports, and charts that provide meaningful insights into the airlineâ€™s operations and performance, aiding in decision-making processes.


Each task is designed to build upon the previous one, gradually developing a comprehensive understanding and practical skills in creating and managing a data warehouse for an airline company.
